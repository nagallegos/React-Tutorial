# React-Tutorial

This repo will be used for teaching myself how to use react.  
I will be following along with the following video initially:  
[React Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)

## BABEL
[babeljs.io](https://babeljs.io/repl) is a useful tool to see how JSX is being converted to JavaScript code.

## Terminology & Useful Information
1. **JSX**: JavaScript XML. JSX is a form of markup that allows us to write HTML in React by converting HTML tags into React elements
2. **HMR**: Hot Module Replacement. Vite monitors file for changes. Automatically refreshes the browser upon making a change.
3. **VITE**: Vite is a local development server written by Evan You and used by default by the Vue project templates. It has support for TypeScript and JSX.
4. **Expression**: Specifically statements between curly braces are JavaScript expressions.
5. **DOM**: Document Object Model
6. When an application starts, REACT takes the component tree and build a JavaScript Virtual DOM
7. React is only a library and NOT a framework (like Angular or Vue). It is good at building user interfaces
8. It is typically good practice to put all components in a folder called components.
9. **Bootstrap**: Useful CSS framework for front-end development.
10. **Props**: Properties; input passed to a component similar to function args. Should treat as immutable. Will cause a re-rendering.
11. **State**: Data managed by a component similar to a local variable. Can treat as mutable. Will cause a re-rendering.
12. 4 Pillars of OOP:
  1. Abstraction
  2. Encapsulation
  3. inheritance
  4. polymorphism
13. Abstraction: hiding all of the relevent data of an object to reduce complexity
14. Encapsulation: hides internal state of an object to prevent unauthorized access to data
15. Inheritance: one class derives from another and has access to all public variables and methods from the parents
16. Polymorphism: overloading methods (static: early binding) and overriding methods (dynamic: late binding). allows for flexibility and generalized code
